# ComputerCraftThings
Things I have programmed in ComputerCraft, including branches for turtles and (soon) PDA's.
# Install Instructions
the update script (which automatically pulls from this github) requires this github cloning script: https://github.com/eric-wieser/computercraft-github

To install this, run ```pastebin run p8PJVxC4```

Then, to run the update script (which will download all other scripts) run ```wget run https://github.com/Alstro20/ComputerCraftThings/blob/master/update.lua```

This may prompt you to enter what PC you're downloading it on.

This will download this repository (the branch associated with your machine, that is) to the directory `ComputerCraftThings/`

To update my scripts on your computer, simply run the update.lua program that is included.
