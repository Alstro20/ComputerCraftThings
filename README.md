# ComputerCraftThings
Things I have programmed in ComputerCraft, including branches for turtles and (soon) PDA's.
# Install Instructions
These scripts rely on this github script:https://github.com/eric-wieser/computercraft-github

This is automatically installed in the update process, so simply run ```wget run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alstro20/ComputerCraftThings/master/update.lua```.

This may pop up a few prompts, especially in first time installation.

This will download this repository (the branch associated with your machine, that is) to the directory `ComputerCraftThings/`

To update, simply run `update.lua` at any time.
