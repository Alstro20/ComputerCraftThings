# ComputerCraftThings

Things I have programmed in ComputerCraft, including branches for turtles and (soon) PDA's.

# Install Instructions

These scripts rely on this github script: https://github.com/eric-wieser/computercraft-github

This is automatically installed in the update process, so simply run ```wget run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alstro20/ComputerCraftThings/master/update.lua``` on any in-game computer.

This may pop up a few prompts, especially in first time installation.

This will download this repository (the branch associated with your machine, that is) to the directory `ComputerCraftThings/`.

To update, simply run `update.lua` at any time.
